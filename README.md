## 1. Inheritance
Inheritance is a core concept in object-oriented programming that allows a derived class to inherit attributes and methods from a base class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. For example, a `Car` class can inherit from a `Vehicle` class, enabling it to use common properties and methods defined in `Vehicle`.

## 2. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows functions or methods to operate differently based on the object they are acting upon. It can be achieved through:
- **Compile-time polymorphism**: via method overloading and operator overloading.
- **Runtime polymorphism**: using inheritance and virtual functions.

## 3. Operator Overloading
Operator overloading enables developers to define custom behavior for operators (e.g., +, -, *) when applied to user-defined types (classes). This feature allows operators to work intuitively with objects of your class.

## 4. Types of Constructors
C++ supports several types of constructors:
- **Default Constructor**: A constructor with no parameters or with all parameters having default values.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor that takes parameters to initialize an object with specific values.
- **Copy Constructor**: A constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.
- **Move Constructor**: A constructor that transfers resources from a temporary object to a new object, optimizing performance.

## 5. Virtual Keyword
The `virtual` keyword indicates that a method is intended to be overridden in derived classes. It enables dynamic dispatch, allowing the program to determine which method implementation to call at runtime based on the object's type.

## 6. Override Keyword
The `override` keyword specifies that a method is meant to override a virtual method in a base class. It provides safety by ensuring the method signature matches that of the base class, generating a compiler error if no matching method exists.

## 7. Final Keyword
The `final` keyword can be used to indicate that:
- A class cannot be inherited from (final class).
- A virtual method cannot be overridden in derived classes (final method).

## 8. Pure Method
A pure virtual method is a virtual method declared in a base class without implementation, denoted by `= 0`. It forces derived classes to implement the method. Classes containing pure virtual methods are considered abstract and cannot be instantiated.

## 9. Need for Virtual Functions
Virtual functions are essential for achieving runtime polymorphism, allowing derived classes to provide specific implementations of a base class method. They are crucial in designing class hierarchies with varying behaviors across subclasses.

## 10. Dynamic_cast
`dynamic_cast` is an operator that safely converts pointers or references between types in an inheritance hierarchy. It performs runtime type checking, returning `nullptr` for pointers or throwing an exception for references if the cast fails. It relies on Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) generated by the compiler.

## 11. Unique_ptr vs. Shared_ptr
- **unique_ptr**: A smart pointer that exclusively owns a dynamically allocated object. It cannot be copied, only moved, ensuring single ownership of the resource.
- **shared_ptr**: A smart pointer that allows multiple pointers to share ownership of a dynamically allocated object through reference counting. The object is deallocated when the last reference is destroyed.

## 12. Shared_ptr vs. Weak_ptr
- **shared_ptr**: A smart pointer that maintains shared ownership of an object through reference counting. The object is deleted when the count reaches zero.
- **weak_ptr**: A smart pointer that references an object managed by `shared_ptr` without affecting its reference count, preventing circular references and memory leaks.

## 13. RAII Idiom
RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is a programming idiom in C++ that associates resource management with the lifespan of objects. Resources are acquired in a constructor and released in a destructor, ensuring proper cleanup and providing strong guarantees against resource leaks, making code more exception-safe.
